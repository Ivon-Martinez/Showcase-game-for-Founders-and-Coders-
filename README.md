Color Match Game

A game where you have to select the correct color for a given figure. If you choose the wrong color, the game is over!
This game was created as part of my application to Founders and Coders.  

How to Play

2. Click the side (left or right) that matches the figure's color.
3. If you select the correct color, a new figure appears.
4. If you select the wrong color, the "Game Over!" message appears.
5. Reset button to start a new game
